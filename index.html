        <p>We want to allow all the guests at a party to be fully in control of the music that they listen to. This process is currently astoundingly undemocratic.
Our application for the mobile phone and desktop will allow guests at a party to connect to a 'hub' computer, which acts as a source of tracks and playlists.These 
phones will now have access to the songs on the hub.The guests at the party can now 'vote', 'rank' and 'choose' which songs they would like to play, thereby completely 
eliminating the need for a third party. The hub is dynamic in the sense that it may take up residence in the source computer or the phone of a guest, thereby allowing 
all party-goers to have access to all the music that they have together.</p>

<p>Coming Soon!</p>
