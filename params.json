{"name":"shuffl","tagline":"remodel the way you party","body":"\r\nWe want to allow all the guests at a party to be fully in control of the music that they listen to. This process is currently astoundingly undemocratic.\r\nOur application for the mobile phone and desktop will allow guests at a party to connect to a 'hub' computer, which acts as a source of tracks and playlists.These \r\nphones will now have access to the songs on the hub.The guests at the party can now 'vote', 'rank' and 'choose' which songs they would like to play, thereby completely \r\neliminating the need for a third party. The hub is dynamic in the sense that it may take up residence in the source computer or the phone of a guest, thereby allowing \r\nall party-goers to have access to all the music that they have together.\r\n\r\nComing Soon!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
